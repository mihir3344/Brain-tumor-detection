# Brain-tumor-detection
This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying brain tumor images into two categories: "Tumor" and "No Tumor". The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for fine-tuning. It employs various data augmentation techniques to improve performance and generalization
